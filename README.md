# bomberman-game
created a bomberman game using html canvas API and javascript.

I used a 2d array to reperesent the gameboard as a grid to keep track of blocks. As the player and enemy navigate the board a grid location is determined and updated based on its x and y coordiantes on the canvas. As the game objects move or are placed on the board, their grid location is used to check against the 2d array in order to determine if a collision exists.
